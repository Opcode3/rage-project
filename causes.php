    <strong>Our Causes</strong>
    <p>At R.A.G.E., we are committed to addressing the root causes of educational inequality in Nigeria. Through our targeted initiatives and programs, we tackle the following key causes:</p>
  </section>

  <section id="causes">
    <div class="">
      <strong>1. Poverty Alleviation</strong>
      <p>Poverty remains one of the biggest barriers to education in Nigeria. Many families struggle to afford basic necessities, let alone school fees and supplies. By providing free education, we aim to alleviate the financial burden on families and ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <strong>2. Access to Education</strong>
      <p>In many parts of Nigeria, access to quality education is limited, particularly in rural and underserved communities. We work to bridge this gap by establishing schools, mobile learning centers, and community-based programs that bring education directly to those who need it most.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <strong>3. Gender Equality</strong>
      <p>Gender inequality continues to hinder girls' access to education in Nigeria. Cultural norms, early marriage, and other factors often prevent girls from attending school or completing their education. Through targeted interventions and advocacy efforts, we strive to promote gender equality and empower girls to pursue their educational aspirations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <strong>4. Infrastructure and Resources</strong>
      <p>Lack of adequate infrastructure and resources, such as classrooms, textbooks, and trained teachers, further exacerbate educational inequality in Nigeria. We invest in infrastructure development, provide educational materials, and offer professional development opportunities for educators to ensure that children have the resources they need to learn and thrive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">

      <strong>5. Socioeconomic Inequity</strong>
      <p>Socioeconomic disparities contribute to educational inequity in Nigeria, with children from low-income families facing greater challenges in accessing quality education. We work to level the playing field by offering scholarships, financial assistance, and support services to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
