      <strong>Our Story</strong>
      <p>Established in 2000, R.A.G.E. - Rights and Aid Group for Education - is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free education to underserved Nigerian children. Founded in Abuja, Nigeria, our organization was born out of a shared commitment to break the cycle of poverty through the power of education.</p>

        <strong>Our Approach</strong>
        <p>We believe in a holistic approach to education that goes beyond academics. In addition to traditional subjects like mathematics, science, and language arts, our programs focus on developing critical thinking skills, fostering creativity, and nurturing emotional intelligence. We also provide extracurricular activities, mentorship, and support services to ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed.</p>
